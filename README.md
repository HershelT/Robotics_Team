# Robotics_Team
Code from my extravagant adventures as Captain of the Robotics team and Coding Division.
Miscellaneous Robotics code that accomplishes various tasks throughout the engineering process of building and programming the robots. Among the important code is the CameraDetection.c and Camera_to_Pick_Up_Ball.c. The former detects an object in a plane using the camera. The latter uses the camera to create a sweeping robot that checks for the object, moves towards it, centers the claw with the object, grabs the object using a distance sensor, picks up the object with claws, and throws object when Analog push sensor is pushed.
